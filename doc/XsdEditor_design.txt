Design of the XSD Editor plugin



Delete Objects:
the delete command is trapped by the window,
 the selected item (only one?) is found
 the associated element is found
 the message is sent to the element
 the element detach from the parent
 the parent emits a message
 the message is trapped by the graphical item that destroys itself
