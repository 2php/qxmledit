QXmlEdit Installation
=====================

Requirements
============

QXmlEdit requires QT 4 or QT 5 (4.7 or higher) to be installed. Qt sqlite driver and QtSql module are
required.

Quick Guide
===========

QXmlEdit is built and installed using qmake. The package is composed by
an application and some libraries.
In the main folder there is a main QxmlEdit.pro file.

Extract the source, go to top folder

   qmake
   make
   sudo make install

The file DISTRIBUTING contains a list of files that should take part in a binary distribution.
To configure the destination folders, check the marker 'BEGIN INSTALLATION FOLDERS DECLARATION' in
each project file present in the src subfolder.

The program is composed by some shared objects (or DLL) loaded at the program start. When installing
on a Linux system make sure that the libraries are in the library search path.

To compile a release version use
qmake "CONFIG+=release"

In the main folder there are "compile.xxx" batch commands for Linux and Windows, to configure and compile the project.

To parametrize the installation
-------------------------------
The qmake project reads the following variables from environment variables.

folder for data: QXMLEDIT_INST_DATA_DIR
folder for the executable: QXMLEDIT_INST_DIR
folder for the documentation: QXMLEDIT_INST_DOC_DIR
folder for the shared libraries: QXMLEDIT_INST_LIB_DIR
folder for the language translations: QXMLEDIT_INST_TRANSLATIONS_DIR
folder for the includes of the xml edit widget: QXMLEDIT_INST_INCLUDE_DIR

To link with qwt3dplot library set QXMLEDIT_USE_QWTPLOT environment variable to "Y" before
 calling qmake (or define USE_QWTPLOT="Y" in the application project file).


If the environment variables are not set, a default is used.


Note for Qt4 compatibility
--------------------------

QXmlEdit is source compatible with Qt4, but for some UI attributes. It is necessary to remove Qt5 attributes (mainly alignment) added by
the Qt designer to dialogs to compile under Qt4 with success.

Additional resources
--------------------


There are resources for a Linux desktop installation:

.desktop file in: install_scripts/environment/desktop/QXmlEdit.desktop
AppData file in: install_scripts/environment/desktop/QXmlEdit.appdata.xml

Pixmap icons in: install_scripts/environment/icon
Scalable icon: source/images/icon.svg


Mac OS X Note
=============
Snippets and sample style files should be copied in a "SharedSupport" directory in the final bundle.
There is an installation script to create the final package after the build. The script expects some enviroment
variables to be set, as specified in the script itself.
MacOS X Mavericks has been tested with Qt5.2.


Windows Users Note
==================

In the install_scripts directory there is a NSIS NullSoft installer script that can be used to
generate a package compatible with Windows Installer. Simply put required files into "distribution"
subdirectory and generate the script. The needed libraries are in the Qt and mingw packages.
There is a script for using QT5 and another one for QT4.

Qt must be compiled statically to build a single file executable.
